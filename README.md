Simon Game Challenge
Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Simon game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery. The game randomly generates a sequence of colors, and the player must repeat the sequence by clicking on the corresponding colored buttons.

Features
Level Progression: The game has multiple levels, and the difficulty increases as the player progresses.

Audio Feedback: Each button press and sequence has associated sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.

Visual Feedback: Buttons briefly flash to provide visual feedback during the sequence display.

Game Over Handling: If the player makes a mistake, the game provides an auditory and visual cue and prompts the player to restart.

How to Play
Start the Game: Press any key to start the game. The level will be displayed.

Repeat the Sequence: Click on the colored buttons in the same order as the sequence displayed.

Progress Through Levels: Successfully repeat the sequence to advance to the next level.

Game Over: If a mistake is made, the game will signal "Game Over," and you can restart by pressing any key.
